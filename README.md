### How to Run

This application is packaged as a jar which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the java -jar command. I used flywaydb to db version control.


-Clone this repository
-Make sure you are using JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.x
-You can build the project and run the tests by running mvn clean package
